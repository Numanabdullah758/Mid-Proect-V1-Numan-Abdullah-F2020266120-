                    Sir Muhammad Iqbal Kt, was a South Asian Muslim writer, philosopher, and politician, whose poetry in
                    the Urdu language is considered among the greatest of the twentieth century, and whose vision of a
                    cultural and political ideal for the Muslims of British-ruled India was to animate the impulse for
                    Pakistan.
                    Born and raised in Sialkot, Punjab in an ethnic Kashmiri Muslim family, Iqbal completed his B.A. and
                    M.A. at the Government College Lahore. He taught Arabic at the Oriental College, Lahore from 1899
                    until 1903. During this time, he wrote prolifically. Among the Urdu poems from this time that remain
                    popular are Parinde ki faryad (A bird's prayer), an early meditation on animal rights, and
                    Tarana-e-Hindi (The Song of India) a patriotic poem-both poems composed for children.

                    <span id="more" style="display:none ;">
                        In 1905, he
                        left for further studies in Europe, first to England, where he completed a second B.A. at
                        Trinity
                        College, Cambridge and was subsequently called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn, and then to Germany,
                        where he received a Ph.D. in philosophy at the University of Munich. After returning to Lahore
                        in
                        1908, he established a law practice but concentrated on writing scholarly works on politics,
                        economics, history, philosophy, and religion. He is best known for his poetic works, including
                        Asrar-e-Khudi after whose publication he was awarded a knighthood,[13] Rumuz-e-Bekhudi, and
                        the
                        Bang-e-Dara. In Iran, where he is known as Iqbāl-e Lāhorī (Iqbal of Lahore), he is highly
                        regarded
                        for his Persian works.

                    Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi HI PP is a Pakistani politician and former cricketer who served as the 22nd
                    prime minister of Pakistan from August 2018 until April 2022, when he was ousted through a
                    no-confidence motion.
                    Born to a Niazi Pashtun family in Lahore, Khan graduated from England's Keble College in 1975. He
                    began his international cricket career at age 18, in a 1971 Test series against England. Khan played
                    until 1992, served as the team's captain intermittently between 1982 and 1992, and won the 1992
                    Cricket World Cup, in what is Pakistan's first and only victory in the competition. Considered one
                    of cricket's greatest all-rounders, Khan scored 3,807 runs and took 362 wickets in Test
                    cricket and was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame. Khan founded cancer hospitals in Lahore
                    and Peshawar,

                        and Namal College in Mianwali, prior to his ascent in politics. He
                        founded Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) in 1996, which won a seat in the National Assembly in
                        2002,
                        and saw Khan serve as an opposition member from Mianwali until 2007. PTI boycotted the 2008
                        election, but in the subsequent election, became the second-largest party by popular
                        vote.[14][15]
                        In the 2018 general election, running on a populist platform, PTI emerged as the largest party
                        in
                        the National Assembly, and formed a coalition government with independents with Khan as Prime
                        Minister.
